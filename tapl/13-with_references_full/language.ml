  (* Applying "fix" on a term returns a fixed point on that term.
     More specifically, fix is a combinator that provides its input back to
     itself.
     For example if we have a function
       [ fact := 位fact: Nat->Nat. 位n:Nat. fact(pred n) ]
     "fix(fact)" would give to us a function that "feeds fact back to itself",
     providing "fact" as fixed point. Therefore "fact" can now be evaluated on a
     fixed point, and so while "fact" is "(Nat -> Nat) -> Nat -> Nat",
     "fix(fact)" is just "Nat -> Nat".
     Another intuitive way to think about this is that "fix(fact)" has
     "everything it needs" for the recursive definition of "fact" to work; that
     is, a user of "fix(fact)" no longer needs to supply the definition of
     "fact", and can just use it as a definition of factorial directly! That is
     the meaning behind a fixed point -- it is provided, and thus fixed. *)

           by doing "j + cutoff", we account for the variable name in the
           outermost scope where we started (j) and the shifts in the name
           introduced by entering abstractions (cutoff).

           Now the idea is to give back s, accounting for what we would have had
           to shift in s up to this point (which is namely the cutoff). We have
           to do this because tmMap will _not_ shift s when entering
           abstractions while walking "term"! But the number of abstractions
           we have entered is represented by cutoff, so as mentioned, we can
           apply them all at once here.

           We need to shift s in the first place so that free variables in s
           continue referring to the same variables they did before, since
           everytime we enter an abstraction we shift all free variables up by
           one.

           For example consider substituting [0->3] (位. 0 1 (位. 0 1 2)). Clearly
           we can't this directly, because 0 is bound twice twice (per each
           lambda abstraction). But the free variable `0` in the global scope is
           the free variable `1` in the leftmost abstraction and the free
           variable `2` in the rightmost abstraction (because we introduce the
           abstraction binding variables as new variables when entering the
           abstraction). So we need to shift `3` up when replacing as well to
           ensure we still refer to the `3` in global scope after entering an
           abstraction. Thus, we would end up with (位. 0 4 (位. 0 1 5)).
        *)

(** "Top level" beta reduction of an abstraction, for example (位0. 0 1)(0).
    We evaluate the body of abstraction with the substitution directly; that is,
    this effectively becomes [0->0'](0 1), where 0' is the (0) being applied.

    But clearly we can not do [0->0](0 1) directly, as then we would have
    (0 1), which is incorrect:
      - "1" is unbound on the global scope; we really want this to be "0" now
        since we have destroyed the variable "0" previously bound by the
        abstraction, and now want to regress to the "0" in global scope.
    So, we need to shift the evaluated term down by one to accout for the
    bound variable we have destroyed. But doing so immediately would give us
    (-1 0), which not has the problem that -1 is an invalid de Bruijn index. To
    avoid this, we do the following:
      1. Shift up the term to be substituted by one, since the size of its
         context (bound variables) is one less than that of the body we are
         substituting it in.
      2. Perform the substitution
      3. Shift the evaluated substitution down by one to account for the
         destroyed bound variable.

    Running with our previous example of (位0. 0 1)(0), we get
      => [0->(shift 1 Term(0))](0 1)  { definition of application }
      => [0->1](0 1)                  { shift of substitution term }
      => (1 1)                        { substitution }
      => (0 0)                        { lowering of evaluated term }
