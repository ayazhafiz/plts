# simple_sub

An implementation of the type system described in [_The Simple Essence of Algebraic Subtyping_ (Parreaux 2020)](https://lptk.github.io/files/%5Bv1.8%5D%20simple-essence-algebraic-subtyping.pdf),
and largely an OCaml fork of Parreaux's work in https://github.com/LPTK/simple-sub.

Support for type inference in the presence of subtyping and polymorphism.
