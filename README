# Skittles

This repository contains my implementations/reimplementations of type
systems and programming languages I find interesting.

- [tapl/] - selected implementations of languages formalized in Types and
  Programming Languages (Pierce 2002).

- [lang_narrow/] - a language with flow typing, supporting unions and records.
