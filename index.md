## Lambda Calculus

- [Emulating the Lambda Calculus in TypeScript's Type System](https://ayazhafiz.com/articles/21/typescript-type-system-lambda-calculus): Evaluating the lambda calculus entirely using the TypeScript type system.

## Flow Typing

- [lang_narrow](https://ayazhafiz.com/lang_narrow): A language with unions,
records, and flow typing. A checker, interpreter, and C code generator is
implemented.
  - [Playground](https://ayazhafiz.com/lang_narrow)
  - [Blog post](https://ayazhafiz.com/articles/21/lang-narrow)


- [FT](./ft/www/index.html): The FT (flow typing) calculus from David
Pearce's 2012 paper [_Sound and Complete Flow Typing with Unions,
Intersections, and Negations_](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/foswiki/pub/Main/TechnicalReportSeries/ECSTR12-20.pdf).
Like `lang_narrow`, but smaller and proven sound and complete. A checker as
described by Pearce and a self-designed inferer is implemented.

## Typed Assembly

- [TAL](./TAL/www/index.html): A compiler from a System F-like language to the
    Typed Assembly Language of [Morrisett, et.al. 1998](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/2797451).
