## Flow typing

[lang_narrow](https://ayazhafiz.com/lang_narrow): A language with unions,
records, and flow typing. A checker, interpreter, and C code generator is
implemented.

[FT](./ft/www/index.html): The FT (flow typing) calculus from David
Pearce's 2012 paper [_Sound and Complete Flow Typing with Unions,
Intersections, and Negations_](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/foswiki/pub/Main/TechnicalReportSeries/ECSTR12-20.pdf).
Like `lang_narrow`, but smaller and proven sound and complete. A checker as
described by Pearce and a self-designed inferer is implemented.
