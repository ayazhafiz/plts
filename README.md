This repository contains my implementations/reimplementations of type
systems and programming languages I find interesting.

- [tapl/](./tapl/) - selected implementations of languages formalized in _Types and
    Programming Languages_ (Pierce 2002).
- [lang_narrow/](./lang_narrow/) - a language with flow typing, supporting unions and records.
- [simple_sub/](./simple_sub/) - a type system that supports type inference in the presence of
  subtyping and polymorphism, as described by
  [Parreaux's _The Simple Essence of Algebraic Subtyping_ (2020)](https://lptk.github.io/files/%5Bv1.8%5D%20simple-essence-algebraic-subtyping.pdf).
  Parreaux's work distills [Dolan's 2017 thesis](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-dolan/thesis.pdf)
  on Algebraic Subtyping into a simpler core.
